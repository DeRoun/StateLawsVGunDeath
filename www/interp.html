<p style="padding-bottom:15px">Based on data collected from both the CDC and the States Firearms Law Database, as well as the data presented in this application, we believe that the number of state firearm laws does have impact on that states firearm related death rate. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom:15px">When it comes to all firearm related deaths, the correlation between the number of a states firearm laws and its firearm death rate is strong, with a correlation coefficient of - .64.  </p>
<p style="padding-bottom:15px">When the death data involves non-suicidal firearm deaths the coefficient drops to - .21. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom:15px">While the this could be interpreted as not strong enough a correlation to implement new legislation we would argue that, statistically, if the law could save only a few lives it would be worth it. </p>
<p style="padding-bottom:15px">All in all, we believe that the data supports the theory that the number of gun laws in a state influences that stateâ€™s firearm related death rate. </p>
